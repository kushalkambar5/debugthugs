### 3. [backend](file:///d:/debug_thugs/backend) (Express API Server)
A Node.js & Express server running on port `5000` serving as the centralized orchestrator:
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL database powered by **Drizzle ORM** for handling users, doctor profiles, patient assignments, scans, metrics, and reports.
- **Authentication & Onboarding**: Proxy header extraction and token validation (JWT) for secure registration and profile customization.
- **File Upload Service**: Direct multipart streaming and upload to **Cloudflare R2** buckets for profile images, disease scans, and PDF medical reports.
- **Clinical AI Summary Integrations**: Connects to **OpenCode Zen (DeepSeek)** to generate medical descriptions, actionable suggestions, medicine lists, and anatomical impact zones for every scan and uploaded report.
- **Service Proxies**: Exposes unified gateways to the FastAPI models and MedGemma servers.

### 4. [ai_models](file:///d:/debug_thugs/ai_models) (FastAPI AI Models)
A FastAPI Python server running on port `8000` that loads and executes predictions on 6 localized medical diagnostic models:
1. **Bone Fracture Detection**: YOLOv8 object detection on X-rays (`POST /predict/bone`).
2. **Brain Tumor Detection**: YOLOv8 object detection on MRIs (`POST /predict/brain`).
3. **ECG Arrhythmia Classification**: 1D-CNN classifying 187-point heartbeat signals (`POST /predict/ecg`).
4. **Heart Disease Risk Prediction**: XGBoost model predicting cardiovascular risk using clinical tabular biometrics (`POST /predict/heart`).
5. **Chest X-Ray Pathology**: DenseNet121 (TorchXRayVision) multi-label chest pathology analyzer (`POST /predict/chest`).
6. **Skin Disease Detection**: YOLOv8 classification of benign/malignant skin conditions (`POST /predict/skin`).

### 5. [chatbot](file:///d:/debug_thugs/chatbot) (Clinical Chatbot Stack)
- **`MedGemma/`**: A FastAPI Python server running on port `8001` that hosts and runs the MedGemma medical LLM for private, local clinical chat.
- **`LibreChat/`**: A customizable instance of LibreChat running on port `3080` configured for rich markdown-based conversational clinical assistant duties.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🩺 Interactive AI Diagnostic Suite
Patients can upload scans (X-ray, MRI, Skin Photo) or input clinical parameters (ECG arrays, tabular biometrics) to run evaluations. The results are paired with:
- **Interactive bounding box projections** for tumor and bone detection.
- **OpenCode Zen / DeepSeek clinical analysis**: Generates explanations, suggested medications, body systems involved, and lifestyle/clinical recommendations automatically.

### 🦴 3D Anatomical Body Visualizer
An interactive tool that allows users to traverse structural layers of the human anatomy.
- **Layers included**: Skeleton Structure, Circulatory System, Urinary System, Digestive System, Gallbladder, Liver, and more.
- Provides interactive breakdowns and contextual explanations for each layer and organ group.

### 📊 Health Connect Smartwatch Sync
Connects to wearable devices via the React Native companion app.
- Tracks metrics like steps, heart rate averages (min/max), sleep duration/phases, and calorie expenditure.
- Displays comprehensive timeline charts on the web frontend.

### 📁 Medical History Vault
A secure portal to manage diagnostics:
- **Scan Repository**: Stores all historical AI model predictions with their interactive outcomes.
- **Medical Reports Upload**: Upload PDF/image reports (Labs, Imaging, Prescriptions, Discharges) with automated AI summaries generated for quick clinical recall.
